## 📂 Folder Structure

web-automation-selenium/ ├── Facebook_Bot.py       # Script for Facebook login automation ├── Linkedin_Bot.py       # Script for LinkedIn login automation ├── Twitter_Bot.py        # Script for Twitter login automation ├── chromedriver.exe      # Chrome WebDriver (optional, or set path in script/environment) └── README.md             # Project documentation

> You can also organize it by separating configurations and drivers into folders if needed, like `drivers/` and `configs/`.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Python 3.x**  
   Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Selenium WebDriver**  
   Install using pip:  
   ```bash
   pip install selenium

3. Google Chrome and ChromeDriver

Download Chrome from here.

Download ChromeDriver from here, and ensure its version matches your Chrome browser version.



4. Optionally, set the ChromeDriver path in the script or add it to your system’s PATH.

⚙ Usage Instructions

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-automation-selenium.git
cd web-automation-selenium

2. Edit Credentials

Open each script file and replace the placeholder credentials with your own:

enter_email = "your_email@example.com"
enter_password = "your_password"

> ⚠ Important: Never share your credentials or commit them to public repositories.



3. Run the Scripts

Facebook

python Facebook_Bot.py

LinkedIn

python Linkedin_Bot.py

Twitter

python Twitter_Bot.py


---

📖 How It Works

The scripts open a Chrome browser window.

They navigate to the login page of the respective website.

They locate the email/username and password fields.

They input the credentials and submit the form.

You are automatically logged into the website.

🛠 Troubleshooting

✅ Issue: Browser not opening or driver error
Make sure chromedriver.exe is in the same folder as the script or its path is correctly set.

✅ Issue: Elements not found
Websites may change their structure. Use browser developer tools to inspect elements and update the selectors accordingly.

✅ Issue: Login failing or stuck

Increase time.sleep() delays to allow pages to load.

Handle two-factor authentication manually if prompted.

Check for CAPTCHA verification.


✅ Issue: Chrome version mismatch
Ensure that the version of ChromeDriver matches your Chrome browser version.
